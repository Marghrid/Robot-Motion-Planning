<h2> Potential Field Path Planning </h2>


<h4>Brushfire algorithm</h4>
<p><q>The brushfire algorithm uses a grid to approximate distance, and hence the repul- sive function. It produces a map of distance values to the nearest obstacle.</q></p>

<h4>Wave-front algorithm</h4>
<p><q>The wave-front planner affords the simplest solution to the local minima problem, but can only be implemented in spaces that are represented as grids.</q></p>

<h2> Roadmaps </h2>
<p><q>If we knew that many paths were to be planned in the same environment, then it would make sense to construct a data structure once and then use that data structure to plan subsequent paths more quickly. This data structure is often called a map, and mapping is the task of generating models of robot environments from sensor data.</q></p>

<h4>Visibility Graph</h4>
<p><q>The defining characteristics of a visibility map are that its nodes share an edge if they are within line of sight of each other, and that all points in the robotâ€™s free space are within line of sight of at least one node on the visibility map.</q></p>
